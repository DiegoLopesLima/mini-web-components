# Mini WebComponents

A mini framework to create web components.

## Motivation

Sometimes we need to use only Vanilla JavaScript in our components creating in order to guarantee performance and a small bundle, but we still need to create the component classes and a lot of code from scratch. This mini framework is the minimum code necessary to create web components and use some really common features without writing everything from scratch with a really small bundle and a good browsers support.
